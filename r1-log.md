Cracked open [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) again. Started with the first lesson. HTML, CSS, and Accessibility. Mostly basic stuff but I learned a ton about CSS. Last time I took a real look at CSS was in the early 2000s. It has changed a lot. I also enjoyed the section on accessibility. I also joined the [freeCodeCamp forums](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/) and helped a few people out. I really love the entire FCC and #100DaysOfCode community. Lastly, I submitted a few PRs to FCC itself. Specifically suggesting a new link in an intro guide and an updated link in the contributors guide.

One of my PRs from last night was merged to freeCodeCamp which was a great way to start the day. I finished the responsive web design course on freeCodeCamp and started working on the first of 5 projects. I really like how FCC throws you right into the mix after giving you a brief introduction. The [Mozilla CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Keyword_index) has been a godsend while I try to figure out how to do slightly more complex things with CSS. I also feel a bit more comfortable with grid/flex which I've always struggled with.
