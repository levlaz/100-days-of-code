Cracked open [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) again. Started with the first lesson. HTML, CSS, and Accessibility. Mostly basic stuff but I learned a ton about CSS. Last time I took a real look at CSS was in the early 2000s. It has changed a lot. I also enjoyed the section on accessibility. I also joined the [freeCodeCamp forums](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/) and helped a few people out. I really love the entire FCC and #100DaysOfCode community. Lastly, I submitted a few PRs to FCC itself. Specifically suggesting a new link in an intro guide and an updated link in the contributors guide.
