### R1D1 5/5/2020
Cracked open [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) again. Started with the first lesson. HTML, CSS, and Accessibility. Mostly basic stuff but I learned a ton about CSS. Last time I took a real look at CSS was in the early 2000s. It has changed a lot. I also enjoyed the section on accessibility. I also joined the [freeCodeCamp forums](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/) and helped a few people out. I really love the entire FCC and #100DaysOfCode community. Lastly, I submitted a few PRs to FCC itself. Specifically suggesting a new link in an intro guide and an updated link in the contributors guide.

### R1D2 5/6/2020
One of my PRs from last night was merged to freeCodeCamp which was a great way to start the day. I finished the responsive web design course on freeCodeCamp and started working on the first of 5 projects. I really like how FCC throws you right into the mix after giving you a brief introduction. The [Mozilla CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Keyword_index) has been a godsend while I try to figure out how to do slightly more complex things with CSS. I also feel a bit more comfortable with grid/flex which I've always struggled with. 

### R1D3 5/7/2020
I spent too much time on the first project, building a [Tribute Page to Offer Nissim](https://levlaz.org/portfolio/tribute/). However overall I am happy with it. I should have taken screenshots along the way because this thing was a dumpster fire earlier today. The biggest things I was focusing on were properly using semantic HTML tags, and CSS. In terms of CSS, I *think* I finally kind of understand flexbox? I also took advantage of css variables, liner-gradients, and media queries. These are all things that I am not super comfortable with, but I am glad that I got them to work in this project. 

### R1D4 5/8/2020
I looked at the tribute page from yesterday on my phone and realized that it wasn't fully responsive on a mobile device. I think I am still a bit confused on how media queries and flexbox are supposed to work together. I got a slightly more polished version published today, but still not comfortable with this for now. I think the main issue is that I am trying to be fancy with my two columns. 

### R1D5 5/9/2020
I spent the day working on the form project from freeCodeCamp. There are so many [HTML form input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) that I didn't know about. I got stuck trying to add a validation message without Javascript. I'll revisit this in the future.
