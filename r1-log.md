Cracked open freeCodeCamp again. Started with the first lesson. HTML, CSS. Mostly basic stuff. But I [learned a ton](https://www.evernote.com/l/AUhKU_NVPo5DgbjGxBQ2v5NQmc39WzzIQEA/) about CSS. Last time I took a real look at CSS was in 2002 or 2004. It has changed a lot. I also enjoyed the [section on accessibility](https://www.evernote.com/l/AUhOX4bC4nhC57AQJ5G13er-AEvoSd5D48c/). 

I also joined the forums of FCC and helped a few people out. Really love the FCC community! 

Lastly, I submitted a few PRs to FCC itself. Specifically suggesting a new link in an intro guide and an updated link in the contributors guide.
